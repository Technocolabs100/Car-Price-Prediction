**This Project is a work in progress.**

This [project](https://github.com/devsharma96/Car-Price-Prediction/tree/master/ETL/PySpark%20Vehicles.ipynb) engineers **Pyspark** to load millions of used car sale records made across the United States (>500MB) and process them to understand various predictors of *listed price* through an **ETL Pipeline**.


The project focuses on **Data Engineering** - the goal is to develop a safe and reliable **ETL Pipeline** built on **PySpark** that can be deployed for Machine Learning tasks. It is divided into three stages -

## 1. Problem Definition

* Identify the Problem Features, Aims and Variables.
* Configure Tools and Packages required.
* Determine Input and Output formats.
* Installation Setup:
    *   Environment Configuration
    *   Python Packages
    *   Apache Spark


## 2. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Various Stages of the ETL Pipeline:

* Extract:
    * Data Collection (Kaggle)
    * Data Validation
    * Data Cleaning
    * Caching Data on S3
* Transform:
    * Cleaning Data for Project Specifications
    * Feature Engineering
    * Sampling Data
    * Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
    * Data Visualization
    * Caching Data on S3
* Load:
    * Data Preprocessing for Learning Model


## 3.  Machine Learning

* Model Selection.
* Feature & Target Preparation.
* Model Deployment.


<br>

Contents covered in this notebook include:
* **Environment configuration**: Jupyter Notebook, UNIX, Python and PySpark.
* Management of a Spark Session.
* Data Collection, Cleaning and Transformation.
* Data Analysis using Pyspark Dataframes
* EDA using Pandas Dataframes
* SQL queries with **SparkSQL**.
* Visualization with **Matplotlib**.
