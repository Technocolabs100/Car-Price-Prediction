**This Project is a work in progress.**

This [project](https://github.com/devsharma96/Car-Price-Prediction/tree/master/ETL/PySpark%20Vehicles.ipynb) is engineered to use **Pyspark** to load over a million records of car sales made across the United States (>500MB) and process them to understand various predictors of *listed price* through an **ETL Pipeline**.

The project is focused on **Data Engineering** - the goal is to develop a safe and reliable **ETL Pipeline** built on **PySpark** that can be deployed for Machine Learning tasks. It is divided into three stages -

## 1. Problem Definition

* Identify the Problem Features, Aims and Variables.
* Configure Tools and Packages required.
* Determine Input and Output formats.


## 2. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

* Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on a Sample of the Data using Pandas.
* Data Visualization.
* Data Cleaning.
* Data Collecting.
* Data Preprocessing.


## 3.  Machine Learning

* Model Selection.
* Feature & Target Preparation.
* Model Deployment.


<br>

Contents covered in this notebook include:
* **Environment configuration**: Jupyter Notebook, UNIX, Python and PySpark.
* Management of a Spark Session.
* Data wrangling, Cleaning and Transformation.
* SQL queries with **SparkSQL**.
* Visualization with **Matplotlib**.
* Machine Learning with **Spark-sklearn**.

Access to the notebook: [PySpark Vehicles](https://github.com/devsharma96/Car-Price-Prediction/tree/master/ETL/PySpark%20Vehicles.ipynb).
